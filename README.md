# Lab-01 - Abacus implementation in Basys 3 FPGA
> The project involves use of 
> the Vivado design tool to 
> complete the synthesis, 
> implementation and 
> programming of the Basys 3 
> circuit board to allow the 
> board to function as an 
> abacus that performs various 
> operations (i.e., product, 
> difference, modulo, division 
> and sum operations) on two 
> pre-selected 8 bit 
> binary numbers.
